## Functional Requirements
	- **File Management:**
		- Monitor designated directories for file additions, deletions, and metadata modifications.
		- Store files securely within dedicated Urimancy Stores.
		- Replace original files with symbolic links pointing to their location in the Urimancy Store.
		- Files deduplication: if a new file is added, but its contents are identical to another already existing in the Urimancy Store, do not perform another copy and provide a link to the copy that is already existing.
		- Delete links without affecting the original file in the Urimancy Store.
		- Garbage collection: Delete a file along with all associated links when no links remain.
		- Manage metadata (tags, descriptions) for files stored in the Urimancy Store.
	- **Search and Access:**
		- Integrate with external databases to enable searching and querying files based on metadata.
		- Virtual filesystem for browsing files (tagsistant-inspired)
		- Implement access control mechanisms to restrict access to Urimancy Stores based on user permissions.
- ## Non-Functional Requirements
  collapsed:: true
	- **Performance:**
		- File access through links should have minimal performance overhead compared to directly accessing files.
		- The Urimancy Store should scale efficiently to handle large file sets.
		- Garbage collection should be efficient to avoid storing unused files.
	- **Security:**
		- The Urimancy Store should be resistant to unauthorized access and data corruption.
		- Implement secure mechanisms for user authentication and authorization.
	- **Reliability:**
		- The Urimancy service should be highly available with minimal downtime.
		- Implement robust error handling for file system changes, storage issues, and link management.
	- **Usability:**
		- Develop a user-friendly CLI for interacting with Urimancy features.
		- (Optional) Provide a GUI application for managing Urimancy stores and accessing files.
	- **Maintainability:**
		- The codebase should be well-documented, modular, and easy to understand for future maintenance.
		- Implement unit and integration tests for all functionalities.
	- **Deployment:**
		- Define deployment options (standalone application, library, service) based on target users and use cases.
