## Functional Requirements
- **File Management:**
	- Monitor designated directories for file additions, deletions, and modifications.
	- Store files securely within a dedicated Urimancy Store.
	- Files deduplication: if a new file is added, but its contents are identical to another already existing in the Urimancy Store, do not perform another copy and provide a link to the copy that is already existing.
	- **FR-3:** Replace original files with symbolic links pointing to their location in the Urimancy Store.
	- **FR-4:** Access files through their corresponding links.
	- **FR-5:** Delete links without affecting the original file in the Urimancy Store.
	- **FR-6:** Delete a file along with all associated links when no links remain.
	- **FR-7:** Manage metadata (tags, descriptions) for files stored in the Urimancy Store.
- **Search and Access:**
	- **FR-8:** Integrate with external databases to enable searching and browsing files based on metadata and other criteria.
	- **FR-9:** Implement access control mechanisms to restrict access to Urimancy Stores based on user permissions.
- ## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:**
	-  File access through links should have minimal performance overhead compared to directly accessing files.
	-  The Urimancy Store should scale efficiently to handle large file sets.
	-  Garbage collection should be efficient to avoid storing unused files.
- **Security:**
	-  The Urimancy Store should be resistant to unauthorized access and data corruption.
	-  Implement secure mechanisms for user authentication and authorization.
- **Reliability:**
	-  The Urimancy service should be highly available with minimal downtime.
	-  Implement robust error handling for file system changes, storage issues, and link management.
- **Usability:**
	-  Develop a user-friendly CLI for interacting with Urimancy features.
	-  (Optional) Provide a GUI application for managing Urimancy stores and accessing files.
- **Maintainability:**
	- **NFR-10:** The codebase should be well-documented, modular, and easy to understand for future maintenance.
	- **NFR-11:** Implement unit and integration tests for all functionalities.
- **Deployment:**
	- **NFR-12:**  Define deployment options (standalone application, library, service) based on target users and use cases.
