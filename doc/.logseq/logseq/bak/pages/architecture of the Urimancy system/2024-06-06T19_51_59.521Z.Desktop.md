- **File System Monitor:**
	- This module continuously monitors designated directories for changes (create, delete, modify events).
	- Upon detecting a change, the monitor triggers actions within the File Manager.
- **File Manager:**
	- This core module handles file operations based on notifications from the File System Monitor.
	- **File Addition:**
		- Copies the new file to the Urimancy Store.
		- Creates a symbolic link in the original location pointing to the file in the Urimancy Store.
	- **File Deletion:**
		- Marks the file for deletion in the Urimancy Store.
		- (Optional) Schedules a background process to physically delete the file after a certain grace period (prevents accidental deletions).
		- Deleting a link should not affect the original file.
		- Garbage collection should automatically delete unreferenced files in the Urimancy Store.
- **Urimancy Store:**
	- This persistent storage system holds all files managed by Urimancy.
	- It can be implemented using  a file system with strong version control capabilities.
	- The store should efficiently handle file additions, versioning, and garbage collection.
	- Additionally, it can store metadata associated with files (tags, descriptions) for future search functionalities.
- **User Interface**
	- **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Provides text-based commands for adding files, managing links, and searching the Urimancy Store (using basic filtering based on metadata).
	- **Graphical User Interface (GUI) (Optional):**  A visual interface for browsing files, managing stores, and performing searches with a user-friendly experience.
- **Communication and Data Flow**
	- The File System Monitor communicates with the File Manager through messages or function calls.
	- The File Manager interacts with the Urimancy Store using file system operations.
	- The Database Integration module (if implemented) acts as a mediator between user queries and the external database system.
	- User interfaces (CLI, GUI) send requests and receive information from the File Manager.
- **Database Integration (Optional):**
	- This module bridges the gap between Urimancy and external database systems.
	- It translates search queries from the user interface or external applications into queries understood by the target database.
	- This module retrieves relevant file information (location within Urimancy Store, metadata) based on the database search results.
